# DQA-Learning-Query-Agnostic-Black-Box-Attacks-on-LLM-Based-Retrieval

Our experiments are mainly conducted on the benchmark platform "BRIGHT":
https://github.com/xlang-ai/BRIGHT

To replicate our implementation, please (1) first follow BRIGHT's instruction to install the environment and datasets, (2)then replace the "run.py", "retrievers.py" and "tools.py" with files in this repository. (3)By choosing the specific to attack in the run.py and running desired setting could replicate our experiment results.
